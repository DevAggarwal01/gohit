# The App - GoHit
 As a long time tennis player, I have personally experienced the problem of finding others to play tennis in a manner that is very beneficial to improvement, yet not requiring any charge or membership to a club. For this reason, I created the app called GoHit which allows registered users to find other players near them to practice with, free-of-charge. In the process, I have also developed a feature that allows for registration as a coach in order to support their business while also making it easier for tennis players to find a coach near them. The goal of this app is to provide the tennis community with a system that allows for savings in cost by means of less reliance on tennis clubs for practice and improvement. In the end, users are encouraged to make friends, have fun, improve, and just GO HIT!
